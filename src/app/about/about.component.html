<h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] It uses a
    kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval
    is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a
    university student. -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Wikipedia</a>
